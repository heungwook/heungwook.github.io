## Overview

For years, developing a new web-based user interface for Orion Report Editor is in progress. Orion itself has a feature to create HTML5-Canvas(Javascript) outputs, but these outputs are static HTML pages.

In March 2024, since I got the first order of Web Editor module, I'm integrating Orion's Web Editor module into customer's environment. 

- Web Editor needs to be embedded into the customer's shopping mall site which is hosted in the Cafe24 shopping mall services.
- Web Editor will be a part(Modal or Frame) of Cafe24's product page with IFRME or EMBED tags.
- SSL(HTTPS, WSS) is required.
